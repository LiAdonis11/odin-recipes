    <h1>Lolah's Chicken Adobo</h1>
    <p>My <i>Filipino Mom</i> taught me how to make this traditional dish following the recipe her mother taught her. And though I've made a couple of changes, I guarantee they're Mom-approved. 'Lolah' is 'Grandma' in the Philippines, in case you were wondering. Serve over steamed rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickling spice, wrapped in cheesecloth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Step </li></strong>
        <p>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.</p>

        <strong><li>Step </li></strong>
        <p>Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.</p>
    </ol>
